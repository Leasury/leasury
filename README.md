# Lesury 🦥

A web-based multiplayer party game platform. Think Jackbox — one shared screen on a TV, everyone plays from their phone. No app install needed.

## Games

| Game | Players | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Timeline** | 2–8 | ✅ Live |
| **Demo** | Any | ✅ (dev reference) |

### How to play
1. Open the game on a TV/laptop — this is the **host screen**
2. Players scan the QR code or enter the room code on their phones
3. Phones act as controllers — the TV is the source of truth

## Project Structure

```
apps/
  web/          → Next.js app (host + player pages)
  server/       → PartyKit server (WebSocket state broadcaster)

packages/
  game-logic/   → All game rules, types, and state transitions
  config/       → Shared TypeScript & ESLint configs
```

---

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # starts Next.js + PartyKit locally
```

Player pages open on `localhost:3000`, server on `localhost:1999`.

## Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full guide.

**Short version:**
- **Frontend (Vercel):** auto-deploys from `main` branch
- **Server (PartyKit):** `npm run deploy`

Tests run automatically before every deployment.

## Design Principles

- **Heads-up design** — the TV is the game. The phone is just a controller.
- **Zero friction** — no login, no app install, instant join via room code.
- **Clear start and end** — games have a defined arc, no infinite loops.
